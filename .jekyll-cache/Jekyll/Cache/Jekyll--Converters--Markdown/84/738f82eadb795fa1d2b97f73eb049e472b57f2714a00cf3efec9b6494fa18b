I"Ü<p>Given that we have a sufficiently capable model for turn-taking in open ended, casual
conversation, can we train that model on particular setups to improve the specific
capability on that task?</p>

<p>One important aspect of this work is to (make better) robots and their
turntaking behavior. A common approach to turn-taking in robots has been to
listen to audio, determine if the user is speaking, after the user stops
speaking wait for a certain duration of time and if the user does not speak
during that time initiate an utterance. This is a very simple approach and often
lead to feelings of uncertainties about if the robot actually heard what the
user said. On top of this it could lead to both robot and users starts talking
at about the same time, a bad conversational organization moment.</p>

<p>What if we could train our turn-taking model on human-human dialog and then
transfer it to robot-human dialogs. Could we get a policy that would be more
fluid and take the turns mode appropriately?</p>

<p>How can we achieve transfer learning? Well the most straightforward
implementation would be to train on a corpora and then test on another after
which we train on a subset of the new corpora and see if we can better our
performance.</p>

<p>One thing to test would be to train on a corpora of casual spoken dialog
(switchboard) and see how well it performs on a corpora with a specific
task/setup (maptask)</p>

  <li>Use sample dialogs to train on and just finetune on this new dataset
    <ul>
      <li>How much is forgotten? Loss on original training data?</li>
      <li>Freeze the weights of the network and retrain the output layer</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Train specifically to easily learn new tasks
