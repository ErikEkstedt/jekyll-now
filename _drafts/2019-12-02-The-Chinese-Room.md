* You are the protaganist
* You find yourself in a room
* There are many rooms and they all have at least one door leading to another room
* Can you find your way? 
* "Where am I?" 
* "Where should I go?" 
* "Am I stuck in a loop?"

Some rooms contains windows,

### Ideas

* There should be an object analagous to each of the senses. 
* There should be a story about figuring out something of an object. 
    - Vision: windows -> solving a vision classification task; understanding vision
    - Hearing: Speakers -> solving an audio classification task; understanding hearing
    - Nobs: Math -> nobby math things -> GMMs, Hyperparameters, Loss functions
    - MotorSensory: Gestures and movements -> RL running and gesture generation, sequences
    - Text: NLP -> LM, sequences
    - Dialog: Hearing + text (+task) -> Turn-taking, Chatbots
* The capabilities to interconnect different rooms.
  * This capability is instantiated by the path of the hallways between defined rooms are made shorter. 
  - Math: Graphs
* A task is solved by moving between connected rooms
    - Success: grants the ability to move objects between rooms. 
* Now we can construct custom rooms and the need to run decreases.
  - Here we can, for example, 
  - stick together the multiple windows to one larger window containing the smaller ones.
  - Listen to many audio clips in one clip
* A task solved by moving between 2 custom built rooms
  * Success: Unlock AIs to compress information
* Task that requires reasoning given the knowledge through sense-objects + AIs
* The ability to sense everything directly and not through the objects is gained and the protagonist wakes up.
