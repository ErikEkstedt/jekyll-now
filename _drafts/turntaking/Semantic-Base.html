Turn-taking is at its base define by the semantic content of the interlocutors.

<h1>Problem Formulation</h1>

<p>
The underlying goal for a turn-taking system is to correctly decide when to generate a response and when to listen. The response may fill different functions such as
acknowledgments, backchannels or grabbing the turn.
</p>


<p>
In a dialog every word uttered by a participant has a correlated silence (can be 0) before and after the duration of the word. Words at the end of turns or at turn relevant
places, TRPs, will, arguably, on average have longer correlated post-silences than their counterparts. The last word of an actual turn will have a longer associated silence
because the utterer will wait for the other participant to grab the turn in addition to the duration of the actual response. Given a TRP, where the turn could be shifted but
wasn't, the turn yielder will, on average, wait for a response for some duration before resolving the resulted silence.
</p>

<p>
Let each spoken word, \(x_i\), in a dialog corpus have an associated post-silence, \(y_i\) and learn to classify \(y_i = F(x_{i\geq})\). The values \(y_i \in Y\) can either be
classified as discretized bins or as continuous values predicted through regression.
</p>

<h1>Data</h1>


The data corpus we focus on is Switchboard, a popular dialog dataset consiting of phone conversations. The corpus have annotated words and their assoiciated time of utterence
refered to here as timed words.


Lets extract all the timed words from the corpus along with their associated post-silence and their duration for good measure. Below the top 50 words ordered by frequency, post-silence and duration are
shown.
