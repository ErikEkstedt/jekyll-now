<code>
    solo_condition_backchannels = [
        "yeah",
        "right",
        "oh",
        "huh",
        "okay",
        "mhm",
        "uh-huh",
        "um-hum",
        "hum",
        "hm",
    ]
    solo_condition_backchannels += [
        f"[laughter-{bc}]" for bc in solo_condition_backchannels
    ]
