<h1>Backchannels/Acknowledgements</h1>


In the switchboard dataset there are several variants of backchannels. However, these words can be used as more things than backchannels. the word "right" could be an acknowledgment but could also
indicate a direction. "Yeah" could be a backchannel but also a filler/answer at the beginning of a user turn. So after we have our candidate words we make sure that they are uttered in isolation.
Only a single "yeah" or "right" would be a backchannel but when used inside a turn we assume that it is not a backchannel.


Candidate bachchannels
<ul>
  <li>"yeah"</li>
  <li>"right"</li>
  <li>"oh"</li>
  <li>"huh"</li>
  <li>"okay"</li>
  <li>"mhm"</li>
  <li>"uh-huh"</li>
  <li>"um-hum"</li>
  <li>"hum"</li>
  <li>"hm"</li>
  <li>"[laughter-BC]"</li>
</ul>

    "yeah" in an utterance and not considered a backchannel.

    <br>
    "yeah" in isolation and considered a backchannel.
  </div>
  <div class='column'>
    <img src="/images/turntaking/bmod/backchannels/uh-huh_bc.png" alt="yeah_bc" style='width: 90%'/>
    <br>
    "uh-huh" in isolation, a typical backchannel.
  </div>
</div>






<h2>Training samples </h2>


Let user, <strong>U</strong>, be the active speaker system, <strong>S</strong>, be the one to generate a backchannel.

Problems:
<ul>
  <li> bleed over &rarr; only predict before backchannels </li>
  <li> <strong>S</strong> might be speaking previous to backchannel &rarr; omit samples where <strong>S</strong> is active in context window </li>
</ul>

<h3>Simple Sample Training</h3>

GRU - mfcc or melspec


<img src="/images/turntaking/bmod/backchannels/training_sample_gru_varying_input_lengths.png" alt=""/>
A sample batch. During training the context is randomized,  0-20 frames are cut from the initial context size (not all positive label happens after the same number of frames).
