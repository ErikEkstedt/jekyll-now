<h1>Backchannels/Acknowledgements</h1>


In the switchboard dataset there are several variants of backchannels. However, these words can be used as more things than backchannels. the word "right" could be an acknowledgment but could also
indicate a direction. "Yeah" could be a backchannel but also a filler/answer at the beginning of a user turn. So after we have our candidate words we make sure that they are uttered in isolation.
Only a single "yeah" or "right" would be a backchannel but when used inside a turn we assume that it is not a backchannel.


Candidate bachchannels
<ul>
  <li>"yeah"</li>
  <li>"right"</li>
  <li>"oh"</li>
  <li>"huh"</li>
  <li>"okay"</li>
  <li>"mhm"</li>
  <li>"uh-huh"</li>
  <li>"um-hum"</li>
  <li>"hum"</li>
  <li>"hm"</li>
  <li>"[laughter-BC]"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Training samples </h2>
Let user, <strong>U</strong>, be the active speaker system, <strong>S</strong>, be the one to generate a backchannel.

Problems:
<ul>
  <li> bleed over &rarr; only predict before backchannels </li>
  <li> <strong>S</strong> might be speaking previous to backchannel &rarr; omit samples where <strong>S</strong> is active in context window </li>
</ul>

Learning Problems

<ul>
  <li> Only 1s in label at the end</li>
</ul>


<h3>Simple Sample Training</h3>

GRU - mfcc or melspec

<div class='row'>
  <img src="/images/turntaking/bmod/backchannels/training_sample_gru_varying_input_lengths.png" alt=""/>
</div>

A sample batch. During training the context is randomized,  0-20 frames are cut from the initial context size (not all positive label happens after the same number of frames).

As seen from the images above, around 500 samples, we see the same behavior (more alike than we want) for backchannels and silences.


<h1> End of Turn Detection/Prediciton </h1>

While a user is active (speaking) the system should continuously predict when the turn will end. This information is relevant for a system to be able to plan action and to
take smoother turns.
