The datasets required for this particual problem are audio, (preferably (timing) transcribed), with two or more speakers. For the purpose of this work we focus on diadic conversations, meaning a dialog, meaning two humans conversing.

There are a few datasets out there
- Switchboard
  - Everyday, casual phone conversations
- Maptask
  - Task specific dialog from playing a "maptask" game
  - A 'guide' guides the 'follower' through a map with partially overlapping available
    information
